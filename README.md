  C is a programming language designed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. C is very widely used, straightforward, and can be compiled to a number of platforms and operating systems. C is an imperative language, with a small number of keywords and a large number of mathematical operators. C is also a very low level programming language, which means it can communicate directly with hardware.
  <h1><b>Characteristics of C</b></h1><br>
  Procedural Language: C is a procedural programming language, meaning it follows a linear approach to programming, executing commands in sequence.
 
 <b>Middle-level Language:</b> C is often described as a "middle-level" language because it combines low-level features, allowing for direct manipulation of hardware, with high-level constructs, providing more abstraction and ease of use compared to assembly language.
 
 <b>Efficiency:</b> C is known for its efficiency and speed. It allows for close control over system resources and memory management, making it suitable for system programming and development of performance-critical applications.
 
 <b>Portability:</b> C programs can be compiled and run on various platforms with minimal changes, making it a portable language. However, platform-specific libraries and functions may require adaptation when porting code between different systems.
 
 <b>Structured Programming:</b> C supports structured programming concepts like functions, loops, and conditional statements, facilitating modular and organized code development.
 
 <b>Static Typing:</b> C is statically typed, meaning variable types are determined at compile time and cannot be changed during program execution. This allows for early error detection and optimization by the compiler.
 
 <b>Pointer Arithmetic:</b> C allows direct manipulation of memory addresses through pointers, offering fine-grained control over data structures and memory allocation. However, improper use of pointers can lead to bugs like segmentation faults.
 
 <b>Standard Library:</b> C comes with a standard library that provides various functions for tasks like input/output, string manipulation, memory allocation, and mathematical operations. These functions form the foundation of many C programs.
 
 
 egacy and Popularity: C has a rich history and remains widely used today, particularly in system programming, embedded systems, and software development where performance and control are critical.
 
 lose to Hardware: C allows direct access to hardware components and system-level functionalities, making it suitable for tasks like device driver development and operating system programming.
