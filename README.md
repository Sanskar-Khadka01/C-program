<img src="C_Logo.png" width="150" align="center">C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972. C is very widely used, straightforward, and can be compiled to a number of platforms and operating systems.  C is an imperative language, with a small number of keywords and a large number of mathematical operators. C is also a very low level programming language, which means it can communicate directly with hardware.
